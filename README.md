# UK Traffic Accident Analysis
Accidents Analysis of UK from 2005-2014

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
The UK government has collected comprehensive traffic accident data from 2005 to 2014, recording over 1.6 million accidents. This dataset provides a detailed view of the traffic conditions and incidents over a significant period, offering valuable insights into trends, patterns, and changes in road safety.

## Objectives

- Analyze the trends and patterns in traffic accidents in the UK from 2005 to 2014.
- Identify the factors contributing to traffic accidents.
- Provide data-driven recommendations for improving road safety.

## Data Description

The dataset includes the following key information:

Accident Date and Time: When the accident occurred.
Location: Where the accident happened.
Severity: The severity of the accident.
Weather Conditions: Weather during the accident.
Road Conditions: Conditions of the road.
Vehicle Types: Types of vehicles involved in the accident.
Casualties: Information on injuries and fatalities.

## Methodology

Step 1: Data Exploration
Load and inspect the data: Understand the structure and content of the dataset.
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, correct data types, and remove duplicates.

Step 2: Data Analysis
Trend Analysis: Examine the number of accidents per year to identify any trends.
Severity Analysis: Analyze the severity of accidents over the years.
Location Analysis: Identify accident hotspots.
Factor Analysis: Investigate the impact of weather, road conditions, and other factors on the frequency and severity of accidents.

Step 3: Visualization
Create visualizations to highlight key findings from the analysis:
Time series plots for trends.
Bar charts and pie charts for categorical data.

## Key Findings

Trends: The overall trend in traffic accidents over the years.
Factors: Key factors contributing to accidents, such as speed limits and road types.
